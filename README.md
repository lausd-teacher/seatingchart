A simple seating chart for schoology LMS used in Havaseet App, which is developed and maintained by Lee ViDemantay.
##About Lee...
   I am full time educator hobbying as a programmer in order to bring more practicale tools to the classroom. My passion was born from the lack of integrated tools.**
   I am hoping to create of educators, software developers and other stakeholders that can develop a one-stop-shop for the educators of my district
   and others who are using the Schoology LMS.**

##About the software
  This page just shares the client side portion of the software.  I am using Jquery, Jquery-Ui, Jquery-ui-rotatable and Materialize.
  Certain objects are sturctured from the Schoology Api- Course, Students, Teacher.
  Others are structured on the app SeatingChart, Procedures, Stations and Groups although Groups does use Schoology's GradingGroups as part of it structure.

##How to help
    I need help on every aspect of the software lifecycle! Let's build a network of developers, hackers, and hobbiests that can extend this code
    to build a truly helpful tool for educators the world over.
###Software Goals
    I want to use this software to help manage teachers' routines.  Routines include a seating layout, groups, procedures, and station rotation management. Eventually should include Behavior Management and a quick Attendance and Assignment check mechanism.
    Please see the Wiki for more information on Object specifics.
