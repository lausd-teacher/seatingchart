# Seatingchart

A simple seating chart for schoology LMS used in [Havaseet App](https://app.schoology.com/apps/profile/1522121881), which is developed and maintained by [Lee ViDemantay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/videmantay/).
## About Lee...
I am full time educator hobbying as a programmer in order to bring more practical tools to the classroom. My passion was born from the lack of integrated tools. I am hoping to create of educators, software developers and other stakeholders that can develop a one-stop-shop for the educators of my district and others who are using the Schoology LMS.

## About the software
This page just shares the client side portion of the software.  I am using [JQuery](https://api.jquery.com), [JQuery-Ui](https://api.jqueryui.com), [JQuery-ui-rotatable](https://github.com/godswearhats/jquery-ui-rotatable) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com). Certain objects are sturctured from the [Schoology Api](https://developers.schoology.com/api)- Course, Students, Teacher. Others are structured on the app SeatingChart, Procedures, Stations and Groups although Groups does use Schoology's GradingGroups as part of it structure.

## How to help
I need help on every aspect of the software lifecycle! Let's build a network of developers, hackers, and hobbiests that can extend this code to build a truly helpful tool for educators the world over.
### Software Goals
I want to use this software to help manage teachers' routines.  Routines include a seating layout, groups, procedures, and station rotation management. Eventually should include Behavior Management and a quick Attendance and Assignment check mechanism. Please see the Wiki for more information on Object specifics.

I am very excited to be sharing code that has to potential to help educators the world over and I thank you for your involvement.
